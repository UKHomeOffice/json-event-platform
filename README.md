# Websocket relay server (prototype)

This is a small webserver that uses Websockets so that client webside applications can:

1. Receive real-time messages from servers
2. Send back debug info / debug events to be logged on the server side.

This is a technical proof-of-concept on how much work it would be to create a Scala http4s backend with websockets support.
